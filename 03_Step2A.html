    <p>The town you stopped in is super small. You found a great little cafe for lunch and a coffee. The barista at the cafe recommended a scenic route for your road trip that heads towards a campsite instead of just continuing to follow the interstate.</p>
      <p>Do you want to follow the scenic route and go camping?</p>
