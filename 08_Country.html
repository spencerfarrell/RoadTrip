    <p>Your journey to the country starts off okay. But as you near the charger, your internet connection is lost. You are forced to pull over. Unfortunately, you are so far out in the middle of nowhere, there is nobody to help you for days. You camp another night in your car. The next day after hours of waiting, someone driving a Mercedes camper van helps you out. They talk about how great their life is living that #VanLyfe. You are obsessed with their lifestyle and their #VanLyfe Instagram so you decide that you want to go on an endless road trip with this person.</p>
      <p>Congrats, you never ended your road trip and you will be living life in a van with a stranger forever.</p>
        <p><b>You Win!</b></p>
