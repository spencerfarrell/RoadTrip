    <p>While the motel was cheap, it was not an enjoyable stay. You didn't sleep good and the door kept randomly opening during the night. Freezing wind rushed in as the door kept opening and slamming shut on its own. You are convinced it is some type of ghost as you are sure that you locked the door before you went to bed.
