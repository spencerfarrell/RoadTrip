    <p>The hotel was very expensive and luxurious. You slept well almost the entire night. That was until the kids in the room above you decided it was time to jump on the bed at 3am. You grab a coffee from the hotel coffee shop. After your rough night of sleep last night, you ask the barista if there is anywhere to camp nearby. They give you the directions to a campsite.</p>
      <p>You head out on your way to the campsite recommendation.</p>
